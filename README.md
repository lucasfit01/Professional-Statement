# Professional-Statement
My name is Austin Aranda, and I am aiming for a position in the tech world. The most exciting thing about cybersecurity is being able to protect the public. If we look beyond the cords and infrastructure within a database, we see an individual who happens to be a victim. I have many attributes, but my two strengths are strong written and verbal communication skills and leadership skills. I am committed to building a foundation for problem-solving skills. My two most significant values are protecting data privacy within a community and committing to continuous learning for evolving cyber threats. Overall, identifying opportunities for improvement and addressing any evolving security challenges can help with my security goals. I am enthusiastic about ethical hacking, allowing organizations to identify and address security vulnerabilities proactively. By conducting ethical hacking exercises, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests, I will be able to uncover weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.
